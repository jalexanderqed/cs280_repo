Parts 1-2 and part 3 of the assignment are in appropriately named folders. Both should compile with Make and run in CSIL or in any Linux environment with OpenGL and GLUT installed. I used CImg for loading texture files, and the library is included in my submission. To run either part of the project, use:

make
./MazeViewer <maze file to read>

My maze file is in my_maze.txt and uses some additional images that are included here.

Part 3 should work correctly with arbitrary mazes since it detects the player finishing the maze by the player leaving the maze area.

When playin part 3, messages should appear when the time runs out (60 seconds) and when the player wins by exiting the maze. When the player wins, they are transported 5 * wallHeight above the maze.

To trigger winning without exiting the maze, simply press "p" for testing purposes.

One feature I would like to add is preventing the player from getting close enough to a wall that they can see through it. Unfortunately, this was not easily compatible with the collision detection system I implemented.
